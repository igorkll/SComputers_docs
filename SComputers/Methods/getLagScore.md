getLagScore():number - returns the number of lag points that your computer has earned, if it reaches 100, then your computer will crash, points will be deducted one per tick, the more points you have, the greater the chance that your computer will miss one or more ticks
if it is critical for your device not to lose ticks, then make sure that this value does not approach 10

PS. if you want to greatly reduce the set of lag points, reduce the refresh rate of the screen
